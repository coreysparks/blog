## The INLA Approach to Bayesian models
The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation, or INLA, approach is a recently developed, computationally simpler method for fitting Bayesian models [(Rue et al., [2009](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2008.00700.x/asset/j.1467-9868.2008.00700.x.pdf?v=1&t=ih5b86ev&s=9078c3b0adb48d4c15bc49ae3ededc6d1cd684c5), compared to traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches. INLA fits models that are classified as latent Gaussian models, which are applicable in many settings (Martino & Rue, [2010](http://www.bias-project.org.uk/gmrfcourse/inla-program.pdf).  In general, INLA fits a general form of additive models such as:

$\eta = \alpha + \sum_{j=1}^{nf} f^{(j)}(u_{ij}) + \sum_{k=1}^{n\beta}\beta_k z_{ki} + \epsilon_i$

where $\eta$ is the linear predictor for a generalized linear model formula, and is composed of a linear function of some variables u, $\beta$ are the effects  of covariates, z, and $\epsilon$ is an unstructured residual (Rue et al., 2009). As this model is often parameterized as a Bayesian one, we are interested in the posterior marginal distributions of all the model parameters. Rue and Martino [(2007)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378375807000845) show that the posterior marginal for the random effects (x) in such models can be approximated as:

$\tilde{p}(x_i|y) = \sum_k \tilde{p}(x_i|\theta_k, y) \tilde{p}(\theta_k|y) \Delta_k$

via numerical integration (Rue & Martino, 2007; Schrodle & Held, [2011a](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/env.1065/full), [2011b](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00180-010-0208-2)). The posterior distribution of the hyperparameters ($\theta$) of the model can also be approximated as:

$\tilde{p}(\theta | y)) \propto \frac{p(x, \theta, y)}{\tilde{p}G(x| \theta,y)} \mid _{x} = x^*(\theta)$

, where G is a Gaussian approximation of the posterior and $x^*(\theta)$ is the mode of the conditional distribution of $p(x|\theta,y)$. Thus, instead of using MCMC to find an iterative, sampling-based estimate of the posterior, it is arrived at numerically. This method of fitting the spatial models specified above has been presented by numerous authors (Blangiardo & Cameletti, [2015](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=--HuBgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA259&dq=Blangiardo+%26+Cameletti,+2015&ots=VSDEJ7wfM2&sig=graudrEKTevK2HR7nozmZ-Y5N0Q#v=onepage&q=Blangiardo%20%26%20Cameletti%2C%202015&f=false); Blangiardo et al., [2013](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877584513000336); Lindgren & Rue, [2015](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211675315000780); Martins et al., [2013](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947313001552); Schrodle & Held, 2011a, 2011b), with comparable results to MCMC.

### Data
I have the data on my github site under the [nhgis_vs](https://github.com/coreysparks/data/tree/master/nhgis_vs) page. These are data from the [NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org/) project by [IPUMS](https://www.ipums.org/) who started providing birth and death data from the US Vital statistics program. 

The data we will use here are infant mortality rates in US counties between 2000 and 2007. 

```{r load data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
files<-list.files("~/ExpanDrive/Google Drive/classes/dem7473/data/nhgis0022_csv/nhgis0022_csv/", pattern = "*.csv", full.names = T)
vital<-lapply(files, read.csv, header=T)


library(plyr)
df <- ldply(vital, data.frame)
df$cofips<-paste(substr(df$GISJOIN, 2,3), substr(df$GISJOIN, 5,7), sep="")

df<-df%>%
  filter(YEAR %in%2000:2007)%>%
  mutate(rate=as.numeric(AGWJ001) )%>%
  select(YEAR, cofips,rate)
head(df)

```

### Census intercensus population estimates
From the Census population estimates [program](http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/)
```{r}
popurl<-url("http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2000-2010/intercensal/county/co-est00int-tot.csv")
pops<-read.csv(popurl)
names(pops)<-tolower(names(pops))
pops<-pops%>%
  mutate(cofips = paste(sprintf(fmt = "%02d", state), sprintf(fmt = "%03d",county), sep=""))%>%
  filter(sumlev==50, !state%in%c(2, 15))

head(pops)
```

#### Data prep
```{r}
pops.long<-reshape(data = pops, idvar = "cofips", varying = list(names(pops)[9:16]), direction="long", drop = names(pops)[c(2,3,4,5,6,8,17,18,19,20)], v.names = "population")
pops.long$year<-pops.long$time+1999
head(pops.long)

dat.long<-merge(pops.long, df, by.x=c("cofips", "year"), by.y=c("cofips", "YEAR"))
head(dat.long)

```

## Get census data using tidycensus
Here I get data from the 2000 decennial census summary file 3
```{r}
#v00<-load_variables(year=2000, dataset = "sf3", cache = T)
cov_dat<-get_decennial(geography = "county", year = 2000, sumfile = "sf3",
                       summary_var = "P001001",
                       variables = c("P007003", "P007004","P007010","P053001", "P089001", "P089002" ),
                      output = "wide")

cov_dat<-cov_dat%>%
  mutate(cofips=GEOID,pwhite=P007003/summary_value, pblack=P007004/summary_value, phisp=P007010/summary_value,medhhinc=as.numeric(scale(P053001)), ppov=P089002/P089001)


final.dat<-merge(dat.long, cov_dat, by="cofips")
head(final.dat)

```


### Create expected numbers of cases
In count data models, and spatial epidemiology, we have to express the raw counts of events relative to some expected value, or population offset, see [this Rpub](http://rpubs.com/corey_sparks/361894) for a reminder.

```{r}
#ratesyr<-aggregate(rate~year, final.dat,mean) #in this case, we will standardize to the average IMR for the period
#ratesyr$E<-ratesyr$rate
#final.dat<-merge(final.dat, ratesyr[,-2], by="year")
#rates<-aggregate(rate~1, final.dat, mean)
final.dat$E_d<-mean(final.dat$rate)

final.dat<-final.dat[order(final.dat$cofips, final.dat$year),]
final.dat$id<-1:dim(final.dat)[1]

head(final.dat)
options(scipen=999)
```

Next we make the spatial information, we get the polygons from census directly using `counties` from the `tigris` package. We drop counties not in the contiguous 48 US states. 

```{r, results='hide'}
us_co<-counties( cb = T)
us_co<-us_co%>%
  subset(!STATEFP%in%c("02", "15", "60", "66", "69", "72", "78"))%>%
  filter(STATEFP%in%c("01", "05", "12", "13", "21", "22", "28", "37", "45", "47", "48", "51", "40"))

```

## Construction of spatial relationships:
#### Contiguity based neighbors
In a general sense, we can think of a square grid. Cells that share common elements of their geometry are said to be "neighbors". There are several ways to describe these patterns, and for polygons, we generally use the rules of the chess board. 

*Rook adjacency*
Neighbors must share a line segment

*Queen adjacency*
Neighbors must share a vertex or a line segment

If polygons share these boundaries (based on the specific definition: rook or queen), they are said to be "spatial neighbors" of one another. The figure below illustrates this principle.

For an observation of interest, the pink area, the Rood adjacent areas are those in green in the figure, because they share a line segment. For the second part of the figure on the right, the pink area has different sets of neighbors, compared to the Rook rule neighbors, because the area also shares vertices with other polygons, making them Queen neighbors. 

![Adjacency using Chessboard Rules](/home/corey/ExpanDrive/Google Drive/classes/dem7263/Rcode15/images/adj.png)

### Order of adjacency
The figure above also highlights the order of adjacency among observations. By order of adjacency, we simply men that observations are either immediate neighbors (the green areas), or they are neighbors of immediate neighbors. These are referred to as first and second order neighbors. 

So, we can see, that the yellow polygons are the neighboring areas for this tract, which allows us to think about what the *spatial structure* of the area surrounding this part of campus. 

For an example, let's consider the case of San Antonio again. If our data are polygons, then there is a function in the `spdep` library in R, `poly2nb` that will take a polygon layer and find the neighbors of all areas using either a queen or rook rule. First we form the neighbors using the rook rule for all the tracts in Bexar County.

### Distance based association
The queen and rook rules are useful for polygon features, but distance based contiguity is useful for all feature types (points, polygons, lines). The idea is similar to the polygon adjacency rule from above, but the distance rule is based on the calculated distance between areas. There are a variety of distance metrics that are used in statistics, but the most commonly assumed one is the Euclidean distance. The Euclidean distance between any two points is:

$$D^2 = \sqrt{\left (x_1 - x_2 \right)^2 + \left (y_1 - y_2 \right)^2 } $$
Where x and y are the coordinates of each of the two areas. For polygons, these coordinates are typically the centroid of the polygon (you may have noticed this above when we were plotting the neighbor lists), while for point features, these are the two dimensional geometry of the feature. The collection of these distances between all features forms what is known as the distance matrix between observations. This summarizes all distances between all features in the data.

# K nearest neighbors

- A useful way to use distances is to construct a k-nearest neighbors set. 

- This will find the "k" closest observations for each observation, where k is some integer. 

- For instance if we find the k=3 nearest neighbors, then each observation will have 3 neighbors, which are the closest observations to it, *regardless of the distance between them* which is important. 

- Using the k nearest neighbor rule, two observations could potentially be very far apart and still be considered neighbors.

```{r}
#In INLA, we don't need FIPS codes, we need a simple numeric index for our counties
us_co$struct<-1:dim(us_co)[1]
nbs<-knearneigh(coordinates(as_Spatial(us_co) ), k = 5, longlat = T) #k=5 nearest neighbors
nbs<-knn2nb(nbs, row.names = us_co$struct, sym = T) #force symmetry!!
mat <- nb2mat(nbs, style="B",zero.policy=TRUE)
colnames(mat) <- rownames(mat) 
mat <- as.matrix(mat[1:dim(mat)[1], 1:dim(mat)[1]])


nb2INLA("cl_graph",nbs)
am_adj <-paste(getwd(),"/cl_graph",sep="")
H<-inla.read.graph(filename="cl_graph")
#image(inla.graph2matrix(H), xlab="", ylab="", main="")

```

### Plot geographies

```{r}
library(sf)
us_co<-st_as_sf(us_co)
us_co$cofips<-paste(us_co$STATEFP, us_co$COUNTYFP, sep="")
us_co%>%
  ggplot()+geom_sf()+coord_sf(crs =7603)
```

```{r}
final.dat<-merge( us_co,final.dat, by="cofips", all.y=F)
final.dat<-final.dat[order(final.dat$cofips, final.dat$year),]
final.dat%>%
  filter(year==2000)%>%
  ggplot()+geom_sf(aes(fill=rate, col=rate))+coord_sf(crs =7603)+ggtitle("Infant Mortality Rate - 2000")
```

## Model setup
- We have a count outcome (deaths and births), in counties over time, and a set of time-constant covariates.
- We have several options in the GLM framework with which to model these data, for example:

- Binomial - $$y_{ij} \sim Bin(\pi_{ij}) \text{:  } logit(\pi_{ij} ) = \beta_{0}+ x'\beta_k $$

- Poisson - $$y_{ij} \sim Pois(\lambda_{ij} E_{ij}) \text{:  } log(\lambda_{ij} ) = log(E_{ij}) + \beta_{0}+ x'\beta_k $$

- Negative Binomial - $$y_{ij} \sim \text{Neg Bin} (\mu_{ij}, \alpha, E_{ij}) \text{:  } log(\mu_{ij} ) = log(E_{ij}) + \beta_{0}+ x'\beta_k $$
 
- In addition to various zero-inflated versions of these data.

```{r}
ggplot(data = final.dat)+geom_histogram(aes(x =log(rate) , y=0.5*..density..))+facet_wrap(~year)+
  ggtitle(label = "Distribution of Infant Mortality Rate by Year", subtitle = "US Counties, 2000-2007")

ggplot(data = final.dat)+geom_histogram(aes(x =log(rate/E_d) , y=0.5*..density..))+facet_wrap(~year)+
  ggtitle(label = "Distribution of Infant Mortality Relative Risk by Year", subtitle = "US Counties, 2000-2007")

```


```{r}
final.dat%>%
  dplyr::group_by(cofips)%>%
  dplyr::summarise(meanrate=mean(rate), meanE=mean(E_d))%>%
  dplyr::mutate(rate_e=meanrate/meanE)%>%
  #ungroup()
  # filter(year%in%c(2000))%>%
  # mutate(rate_e=rate/E_d)%>%
   mutate(qrr=cut(rate_e, breaks = quantile(rate_e, p=seq(0,1,length.out = 7)), include.lowest = T))%>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_sf(aes(fill=qrr))+
  scale_fill_brewer(type="seq", palette = "RdBu")+
  ggtitle(label="Relative Risk Quartile - period average 2000 to 2007")+
  coord_sf(crs = 7603)
```


We can fit these  model using the Bayesian framework with INLA. 

First, we consider the basic GLM for the mortality outcome, with out any hierarchical structure. We can write this model as a Negative Binomial model, for instance as:

$$\text{Deaths}_{ij} \sim NB(\mu_{ij}, \gamma)$$
$$\mu_{ij} = \text{log(E_d)}_{ij} + X' \beta$$

INLA will use vague Normal priors for the $\beta$'s, and we have other parameters in the model to specify priors for. INLA does not require you to specify all priors, as all parameters have a default prior specification. In this example, I will use a $Gamma(1, .5)$ prior for all hierarchical variance terms. 


```{r}
#Model specification:
f1<-rate~scale(pblack)+scale(phisp)+scale(ppov)+year

#Model fit
mod1<-inla(formula = f1,data = final.dat, #linear predictor - fixed effects
           family = "nbinomial", E = E_d,  #marginal distribution for the outcome, expected count
           control.compute = list(waic=T), # compute DIC or not?
           control.predictor = list(link=1), #estimate predicted values & their marginals or not?
           num.threads = 2, 
               verbose = F)
#model summary
summary(mod1)

```

Plot our observed vs fitted values
```{r}
plot(x= mod1$summary.fitted.values$mean, y=final.dat$rate/final.dat$E_d , ylab="Observed", xlab="Estimated" )


```

### Basic county level random intercept model
Now we add basic nesting of rates within counties, with a random intercept term for each county. This would allow there to be heterogeneity in the mortality rate for each county, over and above each county's observed characteristics. 

This model would be:

$$\text{Deaths}_{ij} \sim NB(\mu_{ij}, \gamma)$$
$$\mu_{ij} = \text{log(E_d)}_{ij} + X' \beta + u_j$$
$$u_j \sim  \text{Normal} (0 , \tau_u)$$

where $\tau_u$ here is the precision, not the variance and **precision = 1/variance.** INLA puts a log-gamma prior on the the precision by default.

```{r}
f2<-rate~scale(pblack)+scale(phisp)+scale(ppov)+year+ #fixed effects
  f(struct, model = "iid",param=c(1,.5))  #random effects

mod2<-inla(formula = f2,data = final.dat,
           family = "nbinomial", E = E_d, 
           control.compute = list(waic=T), 
           control.predictor = list(link=1),
           num.threads = 2, 
               verbose = F)

#total model summary
summary(mod2)

```

#### Marginal Distributions of hyperparameters
We can plot the posterior marginal of the hyperparameter in this model, in this case $\sigma_u = 1/\tau_u$

```{r}
m2<- inla.tmarginal(
        function(x) (1/x), #invert the precision to be on variance scale
        mod2$marginals.hyperpar$`Precision for struct`)
#95% credible interval for the variance
inla.hpdmarginal(.95, marginal=m2)


plot(m2, type="l", main=c("Posterior distibution for between county variance", "- IID model -"))

```



```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
final.dat$fitted_m2<-mod2$summary.fitted.values$mean

p1<-final.dat%>%
  filter(year%in%c(2000))%>%
  mutate(qrr=cut(fitted_m2, breaks = quantile(final.dat$fitted_m2, p=seq(0,1,length.out = 6)), include.lowest = T))%>%

  filter(year%in%c(2007))%>%
  mutate(qrr=cut(fitted_m2, breaks = quantile(final.dat$fitted_m2, p=seq(0,1,length.out = 6)), include.lowest = T))%>%
  ggplot()+geom_sf(aes(fill=qrr))+scale_colour_brewer(palette = "RdBu" )+scale_fill_brewer(palette = "RdBu", na.value="grey")+guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Relative Risk Quartile"))+ggtitle(label="Relative Risk Quartile - IID Model, 2007")+coord_sf(crs = 7603)

### BYM Model
Model with spatial correlation - Besag, York, and Mollie (1991) model and temporal heterogeneity
$$\text{Deaths}_{ij} \sim NB(\mu_{ij}, \gamma)$$
$$\mu_{ij} = \text{log(E_d)}_{ij} + X' \beta + u_j + v_j + \gamma_t$$

Which has two random effects, one an IID random effect and the second a spatially correlated random effect, specified as a  conditionally auto-regressive prior for the $v_j$'s. This is the Besag model:

$$v_j|v_{\neq j},\sim\text{Normal}(\frac{1}{n_i}\sum_{i\sim j}v_j,\frac{1}{n_i\tau})$$
and $u_j$ is an IID normal random effect, $\gamma_t$ is also given an IID Normal random effect specification, and there are now three hyperparameters, $\tau_u$ and $\tau_v$ and $\tau_{\gamma}$ and each are given log-gamma priors.

For the BYM model we must specify the spatial connectivity matrix in the random effect.

```{r message=TRUE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
#final.dat$year_c<-final.dat$year - 2004
f3<-rate~scale(pblack)+scale(phisp)+scale(ppov)+
  f(struct, model = "bym", constr = T, scale.model = T, graph = H,param=c(1,.5))+
  f(year, model="iid",param=c(1,.5)) #temporal random effect

mod3<-inla(formula = f3,data = final.dat,
           family = "nbinomial", E = E_d, 
           control.compute = list(waic=T), 
           num.threads = 2, 
               verbose = F,
           control.predictor = list(link=1))

#total model summary
summary(mod3)
```

```{r}
plot(y=mod3$summary.random$year$mean,x=unique(final.dat$year), type="l")

m3a<- inla.tmarginal(
        function(x) (1/x),
        mod3$marginals.hyperpar$`Precision for struct (iid component)`)
m3b<- inla.tmarginal(
        function(x) (1/x),
        mod3$marginals.hyperpar$`Precision for struct (spatial component)`)
m3c<- inla.tmarginal(
        function(x) (1/x),
        mod3$marginals.hyperpar$`Precision for year`)

plot(m3a, type="l", main=c("Posterior distibution for between county variance", "- BYM model -"), xlim=c(0, .2), ylim=c(0, 300))
lines(m3b, col="red")
lines(m3c, col="green")
legend("topright", legend=c("BYM IID", "BYM Spatial", "Year"), col=c(1, "red", "green"), lty=c(1,1,1))

#HPD intervals
inla.hpdmarginal(.95,m3a)
inla.hpdmarginal(.95,m3b)
inla.hpdmarginal(.95,m3c)

```
This indicates **very** low spatially correlated variance in these data.

## Space-time mapping of the fitted values

```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=12}

pall2

#clrs <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(8, "RdBu"))
#mapView(as(map1, "Spatial"), zcol="qrr", legend=T, col.regions=clrs)
```

## Map of spatial random effects
It is common to map the random effects from the BYM model to look for spatial trends, in this case, there are not strong spatial signals:

```{r}
us_co$sp_re<-mod3$summary.random$struct$mean[1:length(unique(final.dat$cofips))]
us_co%>%
  mutate(qse=cut(sp_re, breaks = quantile(sp_re, p=seq(0,1,length.out = 6)), include.lowest = T))%>%
  ggplot()+geom_sf(aes(fill=qse))+scale_colour_brewer(palette = "RdBu" )+scale_fill_brewer(palette = "RdBu", na.value="grey")+guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Spatial Excess Risk"))+ggtitle(label="Spatial Random Effect - BYM Model")+coord_sf(crs = 7603)

```


## Exceedence probabilities
In Bayesian spatial models that are centered on an epidemiological type of outcome, it is common to examine the data for spatial clustering. One way to do this is to examine the clustering in the relative risk from one of these GLMM models. For instance if $\theta$ is the relative risk $$\theta = exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1*x_1 + u_j)$$ from one of our Negative binomial models above. We can use the posterior marginals of the relative risk to ask $\theta \gt \theta^*$ where $\theta^*$ is a specific level of excess risk, say 50% extra or $\theta > 1.25$. If the density, or $\text{Pr}(\theta \gt \theta^*)$ is high, then there is evidence that the excess risk is not only high, but **significantly** high. 

To get the exceedence probabilities from one of our models, we can use the `inla.pmarginal()` function to ask if $\text{Pr}(\theta \gt \theta^*)$

```{r}
thetastar<-1.25#theta*
inlaprob<- unlist(lapply(mod3$marginals.fitted.values, function(X){
   1-inla.pmarginal(thetastar, X)
}))
hist(inlaprob)

```

So, we see lots of occasions where the exceedence probability is greater than .9. We can visualize these in a map.

```{r}
final.dat$exceedprob<-inlaprob

final.dat%>%
  filter(year%in%c(2007))%>%
  mutate(qrr=cut(exceedprob, breaks = c(0, .5, .9, .95, .99, 1), include.lowest = T))%>%
  ggplot()+geom_sf(aes(fill=qrr))+scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Blues" )+scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues", na.value="grey")+guides(fill=guide_legend(title=""))+ggtitle(label=expression(paste("Exceedence Probability Relative Risk ","Pr( ",theta," >1.25"," )  - 2007") ))+coord_sf(crs = 7603)
  

#library(mapview)

#map1<-final.dat%>%
 # filter(year%in%c(2007))%>%
#  mutate(qrr=cut(exceedprob, breaks = c(0, .5, .9, .95, .99, 1), include.lowest = T))
  
#clrs <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(6, "Blues"))
#mapView(as(map1, "Spatial"), zcol="qrr", legend=T, col.regions=clrs, map.types="OpenStreetMap")

```

Which shows several areas of the south where risk the infant mortality rate is signficantly higher than the national rate, with high posterior probability.
